# Agent Creation Guide

## Overview

ATP makes it possible to **create an agent before writing a single line of code**. Our streamlined onboarding process compresses the idea-to-validation cycle from 60 days to 60 minutes.

## The Agent Creation Journey

### 1. Give It a Name

Start by naming your agent. This name will:
- Become part of your agent's ENS name (e.g., `your-agent.8004-agent.eth`)
- Appear in agent discovery searches
- Form the basis of your agent's brand identity

**Best Practices:**
- Choose a descriptive, memorable name
- Consider your target audience
- Ensure the name reflects your agent's purpose
- Check availability before finalizing

### 2. Define What It Does

Clearly articulate your agent's capabilities:

- **Primary Function**: What is the main purpose of your agent?
- **Use Cases**: What specific problems does it solve?
- **Target Audience**: Who will benefit from this agent?
- **Key Features**: What makes your agent unique?

**Capability Description:**
- Be specific about what your agent can do
- Use industry-standard terminology
- Include technical requirements if applicable
- Mention integration capabilities

### 3. Build Brand and Identity

Create a compelling agent identity:

- **Logo/Image**: Upload a visual representation (defaults to ATP logo)
